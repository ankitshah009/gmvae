# DEEP UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING WITH GAUSSIAN MIXTURE VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS

This repository contains, hopefully, Tensorflow 2 version of Deep Unsupervised Clustering with Gaussian Variatonal Autoencoders paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02648.pdf) as an interview task.

- Initial commit may have bugs and stuff. 
- It has been tested with given data (for interview). Note that dataset does not contain any labels in it. 
- I will implement several updates to test this code on MNIST (as in original paper).
- I wanted to define pipeline in a more fancier way but I got bored. That's why "utils" folder is pushed but most codes in it are not being used.
